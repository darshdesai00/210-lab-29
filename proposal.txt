Project Overview : 

- My project will go onto simulate the trends over a set of time periods. The main goal of the project is to show how different 
  companies stock prices, tradinv volume, and even investor setiment changes the occur overr a period of time that is all based off 
  of random events in the market.

Implementation : 

- In this program I plan on using a "std::ma" where each key is basically represented as a company ticker symbol for examlpe "AAPL" or 
  "TSLA". The map's value will be a 3 element std::array of std::lists which will represnt stock price history, the trading volume and even
  the setiment scores for the companies. The program will read the stocks data from an external file named "stocks_data.txt", which will 
  contain about at least 100 lines of stock data entries. Each line includes a company ticker, current price, trading volume, 
  and even the sentiment score. Within the simulation, the program will go through 25 time periods, updating the stock values randomly to
  make it seem like a real work market. At the time steps, the sim will then print a summary on each stock.

Simulated Events :
- The simulation will focus on three main market events that could occur during each time period. The first is price fluctuation, its where 
  a companies stock rises and dips based on the market activity. The second is market movement, it consists of sudden spikes or drops that
  can occur from external factors. And the third is sentiment shift, its where a investor can affect the stocks for companies.
