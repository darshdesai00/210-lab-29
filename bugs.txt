1. One of the errors I had encountered was timestamp printing it kept on weirdly looping through days and it started to stacke outputs.
Fix: Added a clear “==============================” separator above each date for readability.

2. I remember at one point in time that results were all identical each time I ran the program until I figured out the easiest mistake.
Fix: Realized I hadn’t seeded the random generator. Added `srand(time(0));` in main().

3. I was running the code over and over again after and once it looped through several days, the sentiment never changed and it was always the same for each day.
Fix: Added random changes per day, with clamping between 0–100 to ensure it changed.

4. I remember vividly at some point in my coding process I opened my main.cpp and tried to compile I had kept on getting errors to open and read from
stocks_data.txt. The simulation would not start because the file could not be found or opened.
Fix: Added an input file-open check and an error message inside main():
    if (!fin) {
    cerr << "Error: could not open stocks_data.txt" << endl;
    return 1;
    }
this told me if the file was missing or misplaced as a safety pracaution 

5. When displaying the initial market state, each company name printed twice (e.g., AAPLAAPL, AMZNAMZN).
Cause: I accidentally printed the ticker twice — once directly and once again inside setw() formatting.
Fix: Removed the first “entry.first” before setw(), so it only prints once.
New line:
    cout << setw(6) << left << entry.first

6. While testing in VS Code’s terminal, older compiled versions of my code were still running even after changes.
Fix: Learned to always remove the previous compiled file using rm main before recompiling with g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main.

7. Early versions let sentiment go below 0 or above 100, which looked unrealistic.
Fix: Added clamping logic:
if (newSentiment > 100) newSentiment = 100;
if (newSentiment < 0) newSentiment = 0;

8. The random price changes were so small that prices looked static between days.
Fix: Expanded the range from 0.5% to 2% using (rand() % 401 - 200) / 10000.0 to make changes visible.
