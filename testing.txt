Testing Phase — Unit Test Documentation
==========================================

Description of Unit Testing:

- For this lab the main function that is going to be tested is this :
 void simulate_day(map<string, array<list<double>, 3>> &market, int day)

The function above is actually responsible for a whole lot, it manages tasks like updating stock
market data each dayy in the sim. It also applies random price changes to each companies stock 
price and also displays the new prices, along with the daily market avg. 

The main purpose of this unit test is to make sure that:
- The functions correctly loop through each company 
- Prices are updated safely and at a consistent level
- No crashes are happening when displaying data
- The avg market price is correctly displayed
